\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subparagraph{Problem statement.}
We need to find a simple-to-use template to start a project report in  LIPIcs v2019.

\subparagraph{Results.}
This document provides such a template.

\subparagraph{Related work.}
LIPIcs provides the basic template and is thus relevant. But there are many others: these don't apply because our problem statement is about LIPIcs v2019.

Up to here, your report should consist of at most 11 pages.

\section{The devil is in the details}

You may add as much material (proofs, derivations, figures, tables, ...) as you want in the appendix. But make sure your report can be understood without relying on these.
